# ANFIS_Water_Network_Accident_Prediction
This project presents a hybrid AI model for predicting accidents in water supply networks using the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS). The model integrates genetic algorithms and ant colony optimization (ACO) techniques to enhance prediction accuracy.
